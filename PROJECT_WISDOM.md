# PROJECT_WISDOM.md - Inspirations & Best Practices

## Key Inspirations

### Nam Tao (Tris) - namtao.com
**URL**: https://www.namtao.com/
**Key Learnings**:
- Multi-format content creation (technical videos, narrative podcasts, music)
- Consistent weekly output across projects
- Strong project-specific branding (Lost Terminal, Modem Prometheus, etc.)
- Federated social media approach (@project@namtao.com)
- Platform diversification strategy
- Permissive licensing philosophy for content sharing

**What We're Adopting**:
1. Open licensing approach for maximum sharing and remix potential
2. Multi-platform distribution strategy
3. Consistent release schedule
4. Project-specific branding while maintaining cohesive identity
5. Technical + creative content blend

## Licensing Philosophy

### For Code (Rust-style Dual Licensing)
All code in this project is dual-licensed under:
- Apache License, Version 2.0
- MIT License

This allows users to choose the license that best fits their needs.

### For Content (Creative Commons)
All non-code content (videos, audio, graphics, documentation) licensed under:
- CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International)

This allows:
- Sharing and adaptation
- Commercial use
- Only requires attribution

### Why This Approach?
1. **Maximum Compatibility**: Dual licensing for code ensures compatibility with both permissive and copyleft projects
2. **Community Building**: Open content encourages remixes, translations, and derivative works
3. **Attribution Economy**: CC BY ensures creators get credit while enabling sharing
4. **Legal Clarity**: Well-established licenses reduce uncertainty

## Implementation Principles

1. **Be Explicit**: Every repository and content piece should clearly state its license
2. **Track Attribution**: Maintain clear records of any content we use from others
3. **Enable Reuse**: Provide source files, raw assets, and clear documentation
4. **Respect Others**: Always check and comply with licenses of content we incorporate
