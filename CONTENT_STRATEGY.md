# Video Podcast Content Strategy

Based on your existing technical writing, here's a focused content strategy for your video podcast:

## Core Content Pillars

### 1. **Rust Journey Series**
- "Learning Rust the Hard Way" - Real experiences and gotchas
- Embedded Rust with Embassy framework tutorials
- Rust for Systems Programming (compilers, OS dev)
- Migration stories: C/Python to Rust

### 2. **Embedded Systems Deep Dives**
- Raspberry Pi Pico projects and tutorials
- STM32 development workflows
- Hardware interfacing (LCD, sensors, etc.)
- Real-time programming concepts

### 3. **AI-Assisted Development**
- Claude/Cursor workflow demonstrations
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tutorials
- Building AI-enhanced development tools
- Practical LLM integration examples

### 4. **Language Implementation**
- Building interpreters and compilers
- Parser combinators and parsing techniques
- 6502 emulation and retro computing
- Domain-specific languages

### 5. **Developer Tooling & Workflows**
- Cross-platform development (WSL, Linux, macOS)
- Modern development environments
- Testing strategies and tools
- Open source contribution guides

## Content Formats

### Video Types
1. **Screen Recordings with Commentary**
   - Live coding sessions
   - Tool demonstrations
   - Debugging sessions
   - Setup tutorials

2. **Whiteboard Explanations**
   - System architecture
   - Algorithm visualizations
   - Hardware concepts
   - Language design

3. **Hardware Showcases**
   - Embedded project demos
   - Circuit explanations
   - Before/after optimizations
   - Failure analysis

### Episode Formats
1. **Tutorial Episodes** (15-30 min)
   - Single concept focus
   - Step-by-step implementation
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

2. **Deep Dive Episodes** (30-45 min)
   - Comprehensive topic exploration
   - Multiple examples
   - Performance analysis

3. **Quick Tips** (5-10 min)
   - Tool highlights
   - Workflow optimizations
   - Bug fixes and workarounds

## Unique Value Propositions

1. **Practical Learning Path Documentation**
   - Not just "how to" but "how I learned"
   - Real struggles and breakthroughs
   - Alternative approaches tried

2. **Cross-Domain Integration**
   - Embedded + Web (WASM)
   - Hardware + AI
   - Systems + Modern Tools

3. **Open Source First**
   - All code examples available
   - Build in public approach
   - Community contributions welcome

## Content Calendar Ideas

- **Blog**: Companion articles with code snippets
- **GitHub**: All source code and examples

### Secondary Platforms
- **Twitter/X**: Quick tips and highlights
- **Discord/Matrix**: Community discussions
- **Reddit**: r/rust, r/embedded, r/programming

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement**
   - Comments asking follow-up questions
   - GitHub stars on example repos
   - Community contributions

2. **Learning Outcomes**
   - Viewers implementing projects
   - Error reports and improvements
   - "It finally clicked!" moments

3. **Content Quality**
   - Technical accuracy
   - Practical applicability
   - Time-to-first-success for viewers

## Next Steps
