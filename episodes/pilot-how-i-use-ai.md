# Pilot Episode: How I Use AI - Beyond Basic Prompting

## Episode Overview
**Title**: How I Use AI: Building Production Systems with Claude Code
**Duration**: 20-25 minutes
**Target Audience**: Developers interested in practical AI integration
**Key Message**: AI coding assistants need systematic approaches to overcome memory limitations

## Episode Structure

### 1. Cold Open (1 min)
- Show Claude Code failing with `--continue` command
- "AI tools have amazing capabilities but terrible memory. Let me show you how I solved this."

### 2. Introduction (2 min)
- Personal journey: From simple prompts to production workflows
- Preview: Custom session management, requirement tracking, build automation

### 3. The Memory Problem (3 min)
**Demo**: Show Claude forgetting context between sessions
- Start a task, close terminal, try to continue
- Show `--continue` and `--resume` failing
- Explain why this matters for real development work

### 4. Building a Session Management System (5 min)
**Live Demo**: The three-command workflow
```bash
/start → work → /checkpoint → work → /wrap-session
```
- Show HANDOFF.md structure
- Demonstrate checkpoint saving progress
- Show how PROJECT_WISDOM.md captures insights

### 5. Human-AI Collaboration Philosophy (3 min)
**Screen Share**: WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md
- What humans do best vs what AI does best
- Why documentation matters more with AI
- Failed approaches section prevents repeated mistakes

### 6. Real-World Integration (4 min)
**Demo**: Alpine WSL build with Claude Code
- Show `wsl-alpine-build-with-claude.sh`
- Automated integration into build pipelines
- OOBE (Out Of Box Experience) approach

### 7. Advanced Workflows (4 min)
**Quick Demos**:
- Requirement tracking: `/req add` → GitHub issue
- Tool permissions management
- Custom slash commands library
- Git commit integration

### 8. Key Takeaways (2 min)
1. Memory management is the biggest challenge
2. Treat AI configuration as code
3. Document failures to prevent repetition
4. Build systems, not just prompts
5. Let each party (human/AI) do what they excel at

### 9. Call to Action (1 min)
- GitHub repo with all configurations
- Next episode teaser
- Subscribe/follow

## Technical Requirements

### Screen Recording Scenes
1. Terminal sessions with Claude Code
2. VS Code showing configuration files
3. Git history visualization
4. Split screen: Claude output + file changes
5. Browser showing GitHub integration

### Props/Materials Needed
- Clean WSL environment for demos
- Pre-configured test project
- Backup recordings of key workflows
- Error scenarios prepared

## Key Talking Points

### The Evolution Story
"I started like everyone else - copy-pasting into ChatGPT. But when I tried to build real systems..."

### The Aha Moment
"Claude would give me brilliant solutions, then forget everything 5 minutes later. That's when I realized..."

### The System Solution
"Instead of fighting the tool's limitations, I built a system around them..."

### Production Reality
"This isn't a toy setup - I use this daily for real development work..."

## Demo Scripts

### Demo 1: Memory Failure
```bash
# Terminal 1
claude "Help me refactor this authentication module"
# Close terminal
# Open new terminal
claude --continue
# Show error
```

### Demo 2: Session Management
```bash
/start
# Claude loads full context
"Let's add OAuth support to the auth module"
/checkpoint
# Continue working
/wrap-session
```

### Demo 3: Requirement Tracking
```bash
/req add "System should support OAuth2 authentication"
# Creates REQ-0001 in REQUIREMENTS.md
/req-to-issue REQ-0001
# Creates GitHub issue #45
git commit -m "Implement OAuth2 support - REQ-0001 (#45)"
```

## Post-Production Notes
- Add chapter markers for YouTube
- Create thumbnail showing terminal + Claude logo
- Extract code snippets for blog post companion
- Prepare repository with example configurations

## Success Metrics
- Clear explanation of memory problem
- Practical solutions viewers can implement
- At least 3 "aha moments" for viewers
- Comments asking about specific workflows
- Requests for follow-up episodes
