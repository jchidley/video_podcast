# Session Log: Video Podcast Project
Date: 2025-06-01
Duration: ~1.5 hours

## Summary
Continued video podcast project setup, pivoting from generic Rust content to personal AI workflow demonstrations. Created comprehensive episode plans for two episodes and documented recording infrastructure. Enhanced Claude Code session management commands with tool permission tracking.

## Key Accomplishments
- Created detailed pilot episode plan: "How I Use AI" showcasing Claude Code session management
- Developed second episode plan: "Building Custom WSL Distribution" featuring Alpine Linux
- Documented complete recording setup with OBS Studio configuration
- Enhanced checkpoint/wrap-session commands with interactive tool permission management
- Updated project permissions to include comprehensive tool whitelist

## Technical Insights
- Claude Code's unreliable --continue flag necessitated custom session management system
- WSL Alpine build uses OOBE pattern for clean package installation
- Tool permission tracking should be interactive to maintain security while improving workflow
- Episode content pivot to personal tools provides more authentic value than generic tutorials

## Challenges Encountered
- Initial confusion about checkpoint command tool permission tracking feature
- Directory access restrictions prevented direct editing of chezmoi files from video_podcast session
